# AllStarRadioControl
## Radio Control for AllStar node

These scripts and associated addition to the AllStar config files are to allow some level of control of a radio attached to a colocated private node. These are just for the rigs I have used and were custom made for them. They make use of hamlib rigctrl so they should be able to be modified for any radio hamlib supports. However keep in mind that some of the particulars of a radio require more changes than just the radio ID number. Also note that for the IC-7100 it will require at least version 4.0 of HamLib that includes the additional IC-7100 memory functions.

Note also that the TM-271a/TM-281a are not supported by HamLib but can be used with TM-271A-ctrl code also on my github.

These are experimental and in flux, so use with caution.
